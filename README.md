# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock, paper, scissors is a simple hand game played between two people. It's often used as a way to make a quick decision or to settle a dispute in a fun and fair manner.

Here's how the game works:

Rock beats scissors: When a player chooses rock, it defeats scissors by "smashing" them.

Scissors beats paper: Scissors defeat paper by "cutting" it.

Paper beats rock: Paper defeats rock by "covering" it.

The objective of the game is to choose an item (rock, paper, or scissors) that defeats your opponent's choice. If both players choose the same item, it's a tie, and the round is usually played again.

Rock, paper, scissors is often played in a best-of-three format, where the first player to win two rounds wins the game. However, you can modify the rules to play more rounds or use a different format depending on your preference.

It's a game that's easy to learn, quick to play, and can bring some excitement and friendly competition to your interactions.
